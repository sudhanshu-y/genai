      "Pneumonia is one of the most chronic diseases, and therefore, its timely diagnosis is of utmost importance. Traditionally, clinical decisions have been considered as a gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not a practical option in all scenarios. Therefore, several methods have been explored to make the process of diagnosis faster, efficient and as accurate as clinical decisions. In this paper, we have described and proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning technique for the classification of chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of Pneumonia. The proposed model is trained on 4099 images and tested on 1757 images resulting in an accuracy of 96.18%. The evaluation and training are conducted on\n",

      "dataset which is one of the largest labeled datasets which is publicly available. Also, a comparison of the proposed model with various other popular models is discussed. The results indicate that our model despite having simpler architecture and without any pre-training outperforms many of the popular models on several different performance parameters.\n",

Traditionally, clinical decisions have been considered as a gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not a practical option in all scenarios. Therefore, several methods have been explored to make the process of diagnosis faster, efficient and as accurate as clinical decisions. In this paper, we have described and proposed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep learning technique for the classification of chest X-ray images for the diagnosis of Pneumonia. The proposed model is trained on 4099 images and tested on 1757 images resulting in an accuracy of 96.18%. The evaluation and training are conducted on\\n‘Labeled Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Chest X\\n-\\nRay Images for Classification’\\ndataset which is one of the largest labeled datasets which is publicly available. Also, a comparison of the proposed model with various other popular models is discussed. The results indicate that our model despite having simpler architecture and without any pre-training outperforms many of the popular models on several different performance parameters.\\nThis is a preview of subscription content,\\nlog in via an institution\\nto check access.\\nAccess this chapter\\nLog in via an institution\\nSubscribe and save\\nSpringer+ Basic\\n€32.70 /Month\\nGet 10 units per month\\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\\nCancel anytime\\nSubscribe now\\nBuy Now\\nChapter\\nEUR\\xa029.95\\nPrice includes VAT (India)\\nAvailable as PDF\\nRead on any device\\nInstant download\\nOwn it forever\\nBuy Chapter\\neBook\\nEUR\\xa042.79\\nPrice includes VAT (India)\\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\\nRead on any device\\nInstant download\\nOwn it forever\\nBuy eBook\\nSoftcover Book\\nEUR\\xa049.99\\nPrice excludes VAT (India)\\nCompact, lightweight edition\\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\\nFree shipping worldwide -\\nsee info\\nBuy Softcover Book\\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\\nPurchases are for personal use only\\nInstitutional subscriptions\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\nClassification of Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Image Using Convolutional Neural Network\\nChapter\\n© 2024\\nA Comparative Analysis of Pneumonia Detection Using Chest X-rays with DNN\\nChapter\\n© 2024\\nICDP: An Improved Convolutional Neural Network Model to\\xa0Detect Pneumonia from\\xa0Chest X-Ray Images\\nChapter\\n© 2024\\nReferences\\nRuuskanen, O., Lahti, E., Jennings, L.C., Murdoch, D.R.: Viral pneumonia.
